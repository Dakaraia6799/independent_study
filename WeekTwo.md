## Week Two
##### What's New
This week wasn't easy for me because, I spent the majority of my spring breaks going to colleges to get a last feel on where I felt most comfortable at; This wasn't easy becauase I had to depict which college had the best program for me. Normally I wouldve done some type of work related to my study so I woould still have it fresh in my mind but due to all the traveling I just wasn't able to do so.

##### What's Next?
What I would like to accomplish during this week is to instead of looking at tutorials and taking notes, I actually want to start writing code so I can increase my understanding of my study and by Friday have an idea of how this project would look in it's final form.
