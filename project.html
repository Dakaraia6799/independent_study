<h3 style= "text-align:center;">What is shell scripting?</h3>
<p>A shell script is a computer program that is runned through the unix shell.
Functions that can be performed by shell scripts are; file manipulation,
printing text, and program execution. In shell script there is something called "scripting langauge";
Which is a programming language that supports scripts: programs written for a special environment that automates a execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human.
A shell script can provide a variation of a system command where  command options, or post-processing apply automatically, this allows the new script to still act as a fully normal Unix command.
One of such scripting languages is <b>GrepSedAwk</b>, which is what I will be trying to teach you how to use these commands.

<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Grep </h3>

<p>The <b>Grep</b> in "GrepSedAwk" stands for (<b>G</b>lobally search a <b>R</b>egular <b>E</b>xpression and <b>P</b>rint), this section discusses GREP.

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Basic Commands
</h4>
<p> In grep some of the most basic commands anyone can use and understand are:
<br>

- `grep -e` ~ is a command that tells computer to initiate the grep program with extended regular expressions;
which means, 
- `grep -i` ~ the `grep -i` command tells the computer to run the grep program and forces grep to not allow the capitalization to matter when looking for expressions;
which means, 
- `grep -v` ~ tells the program to return all the expressions that are listed that <b>do not</b> match the expression you typed in.
- `grep -w` ~ this command only selects only the matches that are whole words.
- `grep -c` ~ is a command that prints a count of lines that match the expression that was typed.
A cool thing about the `grep -c` function is that, it can also be combined with the `grep -v` function to print a count of the lines that dont match.
- `grep -l` ~ the `grep -l` command prints the name of every file that contains the expression you sent the program to look for.
- `grep -n` ~ prints the line number before each of the lines that matches the expression typed into the program.
- `grep -r` ~ the `grep -r`command reads all given files in all directories ad sub dierectories

<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Importance of Grep</h3>
<b>Grep</b> is a command used to search plain lines of code for expressions that was given to the program to search for.
Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.
Originally Grep's creator <i>Ken Thompson</i> intended for grep to be used for linux but, was later developed to be usable for all systems similar to linux.

<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Sed 
</h3>
<p>The <b>Sed</b> in "GrepSedAwk" stands for (<b>S</b>tream <b>E</b>ditor), this section discusses SED.
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Basic Commands
</h4>

- `c` ~ the "c" command stands for change and when it's used it is to replace the line you are currently on with a new line.
- `=` ~ the "=" command prints the you are currently on.
- `r` ~ the "r *filename*" command reads the file 
- `i` ~ the "i" command inserts a new line before the oeiginal line 
- `d` ~ stands for delete, goes in front of the command that deals with removing stuff, whether it be lines or words.
- `a` ~ stands for ammend, allows for words and phrases to be added after a sentence or a line of code.

<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Importance of Sed</h3>
<b>Sed</b> is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language.
Sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems.
Sed allows one to change and edit the context and outputs of certain files without having to open any of those files.

<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Awk 
</h3>

<p>The <b>Awk</b> in "GrepSedAwk" stands for (<b>A</b>ho, <b>W</b>einberger and <b>K</b>ernighan), this section discusses AWK.
In Awk 
There are three variations of <b>AWK</b>:

- AWK~ the original from AT&T
- NAWK~ A newer, improved version from AT&T
- GAWK~ The Free Software foundation's version
<br>


<br> AWK can be used for simple calculations; If you wanted to calculate without reading any lines for input,
you could use the `BEGIN` keyword, combined with a `exit` command:
<br>
<br>
`BEGIN {`
<br>	`i=1;`
<br>	`while (i <= 10) {`
<br>		`print "The square of ", i, " is ", i*i;`
<br>		`i = i+1;`
<br>	`}`
<br>	`for (i=1; i <= 10; i++) {`
<br>	`print "The square of ", i, " is ", i*i;`
<br>	`}`
<br>`exit;`
<br> `}`
<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Awk Commands</h3>

- `~` this symbol means that the the expression matches what it was being compaired too.
- When `~` has an `!` in front like `!~` this means that the expression doesn't match its comparison
- `+` this symbol does addition when it is paired between two or more numbers.
- `-` this symbol does subtraction when it is paired between two or more numbers.
- `*` this symbol does multiplication when it is paired between two or more numbers.
- `/` this symbol does division when it is paired between two or more numbers.
- `%` this symbol does modulo when it is paired between two or more numbers. 
- ` ` When a space is placed it concatenates two strings to combine them together.


<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Importance of Awk</h3>
<b>Awk</b> is an excellent filter and report writer. 
Many UNIX utilities generates rows and columns of information. 
AWK is good for processing these rows and columns, 
and it is easier to use AWK than most programming languages.
AWK does not only have string manipulation functions, so it can search for particular strings and modify its output, 
but also has associative arrays, which is something most computing languages are lacking.
Awk programs follow the form `pattern {action}`,
two important patterns are specified by the keywords "BEGIN" and "END".
