## Week Six
##### What's New
This week I went back to the beginning to tinker and refresh my memory with the `GREP` command. I started to think about what my final project would be and I couldnt really decide on any extravagant way to present GrepSedAwk; so I decided the best way for me to present this would be to do a tutorial so I can help others understand how to use these commands. Here is how I refreshed my memory I went back to look at grep commands such as `grep -i *keyword*`, the -i is tells the program to ignore the casing of the word it is searching for and just return the word it is looking for no matter the case. another grep command I was using was `grep -v *keyword` which tells the computer to to look for the keyword and remove them from the line. 
##### Take away?
I found that it was beneficial to stop take a break and just go back back to the beginning and skim your notes to refresh your memory on things that you may have forgotten because going back down "memory lane" gave me a better idea of how I would want my final project to look like.
