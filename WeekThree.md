## Week Three
##### What's New
This week was more productive then the last because I dove deeper into the Grep which searches the lines for specific word that the Grep command wass programed to look for the word or phrase typed. I used the command `grep money grepFile` to let the coupter know that to look for words that had "money" in it. I played around with it so I could further my understand how to command works. 

##### What's Next?
What I would like to accomplish during this week is to do a similar to what I did this week but with the command 'sed' where I would be able to try and learn as I play around with the command. 'sed'  is a stream editor which is used to transform text an input stream.
